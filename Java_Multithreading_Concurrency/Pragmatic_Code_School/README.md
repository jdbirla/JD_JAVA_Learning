# Java Multithreading,Parallel & Asynchronous Coding in Modern Java
- https://github.com/dilipsundarraj1/parallel-asynchronous-using-java/tree/final

  - sequetial callto product service and review service both take 1 sec then final result will take 2 sec
  - first solution
      - we can call these service in different threads using runnable and the combine the result as both services ar caaling in different thread will take final result only 1 sec
          - ex: ProductServiceUsingThread.java
          - problesm, code is very verbose nad runnable not retruing anything so that we need to create class variables
          - hanle to creat threads and 
  - **threadpool**:  Now threadpool is solution for above issue using executersrvice
     - this will take also 1 sec for final result
     - no need to manage thread creation and can leverage future
     - ProductServiceUsingExecutor.java
     - blocking call , no bettwr way to combine result and no exceptionhnadling
  - fork/join framwork : used for data parallelism meainf chunking data nd combijne the result : ForkJoinUsingRecursion.java
  - ParallelStreamAPI : used fork/join framwork
              - ParallelStreamsExample.ajva
              - sequntail() and parallel() : for converting in between for operation form squentail to parallel
              -  modygin default parallelism in parallelstream default is no of cors - 1 but we can update using property
 - Common forkjoin pool : used by ParallelStream and CompetableFuture
